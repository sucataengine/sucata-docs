## sucata.input.is_hover

Registers an area as hoverable for the current frame and returns whether the mouse

highest `z_index` reports `true`, so call this every frame for each interactive
region you want the mouse to reach (e.g. inside a `draw` behaviour).

- area `table`
  - id `string` - Unique id, can be the entity id  
  - x `number` - X position of the area  
  - y `number` - Y position of the area  
  - width `number` - Width of the area  
  - height `number` - Height of the area  
  - z_index? `number` - Z-index used to break ties between overlapping areas (optional)  
  - fixed? `boolean` - Whether the area is fixed to the screen (optional)  

**return**

- hovering `boolean` - Whether the mouse is hovering over this area (and no higher-z area covers it)
